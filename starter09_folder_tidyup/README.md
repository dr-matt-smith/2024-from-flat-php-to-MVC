# website - version 9 - folder tidyup

Folder tidy-up:

- the 2 controller classes have been moved into `/src/Controller/`
- the default templates moved into `/templates/default`
- the student templates moved into `/templates/student`
- use of a `TEMPLATE_HOME` path constant is used to make the `require_once` paths easier to read


## Strengths

- tidier !
- closer to the Symfony project structure :-)
