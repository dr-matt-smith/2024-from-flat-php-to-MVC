# website - version 4 - display an object (from a simple "entity" class with getters/setters)

Declare "Student" as a class in `/src`, with name and year, and getters and setters.

Add new "route" of `/?action=show` which displays details of a created `Student` object

NOTE: I have added a `_nav.php` reusable navbar, which is now included at top of each page


## Strengths

- now OO code, giving us inheritance, encapsulation and so on ...
- passing DATA to a template .... re-use of template with different data ...
